# Foundry Smart Contract Lottery

This is a section of the Cyfrin Foundry Solidity Course.
The Raffle contract is deployed on [Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x104eBaC1a952dB4849DB0D41639d8F287b071c7D)
 - This contract use Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/nzlatev7/lottery
cd lottery
forge build
```

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Library

If you're having a hard time installing the chainlink library, you can optionally run this command. 

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

 - Unit tests

### Test Coverage

![Alt text](img/image.png)

```
forge coverage
```

### Testing on network 

 - anvil
```
forge test
```

- testnet (sepolia in this case)

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

This will setup a ChainlinkVRF Subscription for you. If you already have one, update it in the `scripts/HelperConfig.s.sol` file. It will also automatically add your contract as a consumer.

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`
